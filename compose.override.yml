# Docker Compose Override for Local Development
#
# This file is automatically merged with docker-compose.yml when running docker-compose commands.
# It adds local port mappings for development without requiring domain names.
#
# Purpose:
# - Production deployment uses Traefik with HTTPS and domain names (docker-compose.yml)
# - Local development exposes ports directly for easier access (this file)
#
# Usage:
# - docker compose up      â†’ Uses both docker-compose.yml + compose.override.yml (with ports)
# - To test production setup locally: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
#
# To disable this override:
# - Rename to compose.override.yml.disabled
# - Or use: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
