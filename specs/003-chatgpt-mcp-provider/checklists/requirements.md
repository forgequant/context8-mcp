# Specification Quality Checklist: ChatGPT MCP Provider Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete and ready for planning.

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality**:
- ✅ The specification describes WHAT and WHY without HOW
- ✅ No mentions of specific technologies (Go, Redis, Docker are mentioned only in context sections like Dependencies/Assumptions, not in requirements)
- ✅ All user scenarios focus on user value and outcomes
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Dependencies, Out of Scope) are present and complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the specification
- ✅ All 13 functional requirements are specific and testable (e.g., "MUST implement MCP specification", "MUST expose capabilities endpoint")
- ✅ All 6 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., "under 500ms", "100 concurrent requests", "99.9% uptime")
- ✅ Success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes rather than implementation details
- ✅ All 3 user stories have complete acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
- ✅ 6 edge cases are explicitly documented
- ✅ Out of Scope section clearly defines 10 excluded features
- ✅ Dependencies section lists all external systems and internal components
- ✅ Assumptions section documents 8 key assumptions

**Feature Readiness**:
- ✅ Each functional requirement is independently verifiable
- ✅ User stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3) and independently testable
- ✅ Success criteria provide clear targets for completion (latency, concurrency, uptime, error quality)
- ✅ No technology-specific details in user scenarios or requirements

## Notes

The specification is well-structured and complete. It successfully:
1. Leverages the reference implementation (mcp-trader) without copying implementation details
2. Clearly defines the integration with ChatGPT while keeping the spec technology-agnostic
3. Provides comprehensive coverage of functional requirements, edge cases, and success criteria
4. Includes proper scoping through Assumptions, Dependencies, and Out of Scope sections

The feature is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning.
