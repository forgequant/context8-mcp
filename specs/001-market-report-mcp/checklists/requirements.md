# Specification Quality Checklist: Real-Time Crypto Market Analysis MCP Server

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - **Status**: PASS - Spec focuses on what the system must do, not how to implement it
  - **Evidence**: Requirements describe behaviors and outcomes without prescribing technical solutions

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - **Status**: PASS - User stories clearly articulate value for LLMs, traders, and engineers
  - **Evidence**: Each user story includes "Why this priority" explaining business value

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - **Status**: PASS - Language is accessible, focusing on capabilities and outcomes
  - **Evidence**: User scenarios use plain language; technical terms are explained in context

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - **Status**: PASS - User Scenarios, Requirements, and Success Criteria all present and complete
  - **Evidence**: All required sections from template are filled with meaningful content

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - **Status**: PASS - No clarification markers in the spec
  - **Evidence**: All requirements are stated definitively without ambiguity markers

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - **Status**: PASS - Each functional requirement includes specific formulas, thresholds, or behaviors
  - **Evidence**:
    - FR-006: "spread in basis points: `(ask - bid) / bid * 10000`" - precise formula
    - FR-020: "`fresh` boolean flag (true if data_age_ms ≤ 1000ms)" - exact threshold
    - FR-023: "respond to MCP requests within 150ms timeout" - measurable metric

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - **Status**: PASS - All success criteria include specific metrics
  - **Evidence**:
    - SC-001: "within 150ms response time in 99% of requests" - measurable latency and percentile
    - SC-002: "data_age_ms ≤ 1000" - exact threshold
    - SC-004: "within 10-20 seconds of startup" - time bound

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - **Status**: PASS - Criteria describe user-observable outcomes
  - **Evidence**:
    - SC-001 describes response time experienced by clients, not server implementation
    - SC-004 describes startup time, not container orchestration details
    - SC-011 describes configuration flexibility, not specific config file formats

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - **Status**: PASS - Each user story includes multiple Given/When/Then scenarios
  - **Evidence**: 6 user stories with 4 acceptance scenarios each, totaling 24 scenarios

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - **Status**: PASS - 7 edge cases covering error conditions, data quality issues, and operational scenarios
  - **Evidence**: Covers symbol not found, Redis unavailable, out-of-order data, volatility, corruption, delisting, lag

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - **Status**: PASS - "Out of Scope" section explicitly lists 14 items excluded from MVP
  - **Evidence**: Clearly states Binance Spot only, 2 symbols (BTCUSDT/ETHUSDT), local deployment, no ML models

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - **Status**: PASS - 12 assumptions and 8 dependencies (5 external, 3 internal) documented
  - **Evidence**:
    - Assumptions cover technical choices (Go, Python, NautilusTrader) and environmental constraints
    - Dependencies cover external services (Binance, Redis) and internal component relationships

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - Requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories and success criteria
  - **Evidence**: FR-001 (get_report method) → User Story 1 scenarios; FR-034 (docker-compose) → User Story 2 scenarios

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - **Status**: PASS - P1 stories cover core flows: LLM queries and system deployment
  - **Evidence**:
    - User Story 1 (P1): LLM consuming market reports (core use case)
    - User Story 2 (P1): Engineer deploying system (enabler for all other scenarios)

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - Success criteria align with user stories and requirements
  - **Evidence**: 12 success criteria covering latency, freshness, validation, deployment, monitoring

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - **Status**: PASS - Spec remains technology-agnostic in user-facing sections
  - **Evidence**: User stories and success criteria describe outcomes without prescribing implementation

## Validation Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive requirement coverage with 35 functional requirements
- Clear prioritization with 2 P1, 2 P2, and 2 P3 user stories
- Excellent testability with precise formulas and thresholds
- Well-defined boundaries with explicit out-of-scope items
- Strong observability requirements (Prometheus metrics, health scoring)

**Notes**:
- Specification is complete and unambiguous
- No clarifications needed - all decisions have been made with informed assumptions
- Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan` to create implementation design
- Assumptions section provides clear rationale for technical choices made

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `/speckit.plan` to create detailed implementation plan
2. Or run `/speckit.clarify` if any aspect needs further discussion (though none identified)
